# Bin+ Programming Language (.binp)

> ⚙️ A reimagined and rewritten version of **Binary**, now built from the ground up in Rust.

---

**Bin+** is an experimental, minimalist programming language created in Rust. With a focus on simplicity, speed, and expressiveness, Bin+ builds on the concepts of its predecessor, **Binary**, delivering a cleaner syntax and a more robust interpreter. Source files use the `.binp` extension.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🦀 **Built in Rust** — fast, memory-safe, and low-level friendly
- 🧠 **Beginner-Friendly Syntax** — readable and compact
- 🗃 **`.binp` Files** — custom file extension for clear project identity
- 🖥 **Command-Line Interpreter** — run code instantly
- 🔧 **Pluggable Architecture** — ideal for future language extensions

---

## 📦 Installation

> Requires Rust and Cargo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/binplus
